# Accelerated MDM-method
It is an acceleration method. 

Main idea of an <acceleration> thing is to find <cycles> in method's resulting points. <Cycle> is a curved pattern which circumscribes the same figure on each level of some dimension. We could think about it as hundreds layers of pie. 

Method offers solution that finds the beginning of repeated sequence in believe this sequence will tend to be a lot bigger. 

This method bother to converge faster and using this cycles as an update direction on each step instead of using directions from original method.
